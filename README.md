# NewsReader-Admob
Integrate the admob module to my another project NewsReader

A reader for obtaining the news from newsapi.org.

This is the first scene in the app, you can view the news from the source in [News API](https://newsapi.org/sources).
When open the app, it automatically loads the news from [News API](https://newsapi.org/sources) based on the options previously saved.

On the bottom right of the card, there is a button to expand the view, to view detailed content in the news. 
Since sometimes the content part in [News API](https://newsapi.org/sources) responses are empty, maybe the expanded view shows empty.
It's not a bug.

The button on the bottom left is a share button, to share the title and the website.

On the upper right, explore icon, is a filter that control what kind of news to show in the app. When click apply, the app will refresh automatically.
